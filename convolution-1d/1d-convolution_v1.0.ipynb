    "# 1D convolution and correlation in SRME and IMP\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution and cross-correlation have broad usefulness in signal processing. Most recently, they've gotten a lot of attention in context of Deep Learning. Brandon Rohrer has an excellent set of explanations of 1D convolution in this context. I've adapted his visualization style for this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article focuses on convolution in seismic data processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The math in seismic processing is the same as in the Deep Learning application. There are a few key differences in how it typically looks, though:\n",
    "1. Signals are shown with the time axis oriented vertically. This is because events appearing later in time often represent information from deeper in the earth below our feet. (picture of flipping a horizontal thing to make it vertical)\n",
    "2. We usually only care about results after zero. \"Time zero\" roughly corresponnds to the moment of making a seismic signal, while time > 0 starts to show the earth's response from this signal. (gif of truncating the signal)\n",
    "3. The convolution kernel can be hundreds or thousands of samples long. In the case of auto-convolution i.e. SRME, the convolution kernel is as long as the signal with which we're convolving. (gif of extending the size of the convolution kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Surface-Related Multiple Elimination (SRME)](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Surface-related_multiple_elimination) convolves a region of 1D signals with itself to create a model of how these signals will reverberate from the free surface. The result is called a *surface multiple model*. A related process called Jakubowicz-style Internal Multiple Prediction (here, J-IMP) does the same \"auto-convolution\" as in SRME, but also applies a \"cross-correlation\" which removes some events. The result from J-IMP is a *internal multiple model*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following interactive sections break down some of the math behind convolution for making multiple models."
